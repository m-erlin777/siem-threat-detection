# SIEM-Based Threat Detection Using Centralized Log Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of centralized log ingestion and SIEM-based detection to identify authentication abuse, host reconnaissance, and suspicious command execution on a Windows host.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Centralized log ingestion (NXLog → Filebeat → Elasticsearch)
- Windows event analysis (authentication, process activity, DNS)
- SIEM query development (KQL)
- Threat detection and investigation workflows
